Notes
=========
The usage should be self-expanatory.

You can either read the samples from a file or from an GrOsmoSDR compatible
device (USRP, FunCube dongle, RTL-based devices etc.)

If you read the sample from a RTL-sdr device, make sure you offset your
center frequency from the channel frequencies you read (to prevent from
the "DC effect").

In the GUI:
- you can enter multiple channel frequencies to simultaneously decode them.
- to visualize a given channel using the QT sinks you just select it from
the list.
- you can remove a given channel by selecting it and pressing the backspace key
- you can adjust the center frequency at any time

When starting the software from the command line, you can specify many default
arguments. One of particular interest is the '-C/--channelsfile' option:
it enables you to pre-load at startup, one frequency per line (engineering
notation accepted), a list of channel frequencies to monitor.

GNURadio
==========
The application was tested with gnuradio 3.6.2 and 3.6.3 but a lower version
might work.
It also (mainly) depends on:
- GrExtras: https://github.com/guruofquality/grextras/wiki
- GrOsmoSDR: http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/GrOsmoSDR
- PyQt4
- Python 2.7 (gnuradio doesn't work with Python 3.x)

It tries to use as much as possible the "new" features (e.g. message passing
and gnuradio blocks are implemented entirely in Python) to ease the prototyping
and developement and to show that C++ is not always a mandatory evil with
gnuradio.

A special note for MacOS X users/developers:
to compile gnuradio without hitting the annoying python "mismatched version"
crash (when running gnuradio-company for instance), use the following command
line (assuming you are using macports for most dependencies):

	% mkdir build
	% cd build
	% cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/local -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Headers -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib ..
